# rooms is a dictionary, where the key is the room name, and the value is a "room"
# Each room is also a dictionary, where the key is one of several possible values
#   description -> string that describes the room. This should include all doors.
#   items -> list of item names for items found in that room
#   value -> points for visiting the room
#   doors -> dictionary that maps from a door name ("north", "up", etc) to a room name
#
# You can also have other room-specific attributed, e.g. the computer lab could have
# a "locked": True attribute, and you have to unlock it first before you can go through
# that door. Use your imagination.
