# The following assignment statement stores 5 in a variable named
# "num_apples". This assignment statement could easily be
# misinterpreted as asserting that num_apples and 5 were already
# equal (or testing whether they might have been so).  However,
# the equals symbol here means instead that whatever value
# num_apples had before this point in the program's execution,
# Python should put 5 in there and continue with the program.

num_apples = 5

# We can use the print statement to display the contents of a
# variable to the user via the console, but only if we're careful
# to refer to the variable using its correct name.

print num_Apples

# The following assignment statement stores 7 in a different
# variable named "num_oranges".

num_oranges = 7

# We can retrieve the current value of one variable and copy this
# value into another variable using an assignment statement.

num_citrus_fruit = num_oranges

# We can even retrieve the current value of a variable and then
# use that value to store a new value in the same variable.
# (Note how strange the following statement appears when
# misinterpreted as an algebraic assertion!)

num_oranges = num_oranges + 1

# Changing the value of one variable does not typically affect
# the value of any other variable.  Try to predict the number
# that the print statement at the end of this program will send
# to the console, and then complete the assignment statement
# below using your guess.

# The following assignment statements will result in
# SyntaxErrors, so fix them both, but try to preserve the idea
# behind each identifier name.

# statements will generate a Syntax error, and then fix that one
