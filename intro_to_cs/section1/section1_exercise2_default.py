# The hash symbol at the beginning of each of these lines marks
# them as comments, so Python can ignore them and focus on
# statements.

print "Hello, world."

# The hash symbol doesn't need to be at the beginning of the
# line; Python just ignores all the characters after the hash
# symbol until it reaches the end of that physical line.

print "yst?" # This statement has a comment

# It's important to distinguish the physical end of each line
# from the limit imposed by the width of the code editing window.

# For example, this line is much longer that the ones that precede it.  Unless you have a very wide screen (or are zoomed way out in your browser), the editing window has to display this physical line on several lines.  (Note that the whole thing gets its own line number to the left.)  However, Python still considers this one physical line.

print "I give up."
