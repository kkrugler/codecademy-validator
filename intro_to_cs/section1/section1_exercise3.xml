<div class="exercise-title">Write your own statements and comments</div>
<div class="exercise-content">
    <p><em>Lot&#39;s of text to read this time, sorry...</em></p>

    <p>In this exercise you will write your own Python program from scratch that will use the print statement to display text to the user. It will also include some comments to improve its readability for you and other programmers.</p>

    <p>Speaking of displaying text to the user, we&#39;ve been using the <strong>print</strong> statement to do so, because it sends text to the &quot;console&quot;. Codecademy exercises display the console in the rightmost box of this browser window. Other development environments have different ways of displaying the console. For example, when you use the Python command line interpreter, any console output is displayed immediately after each statement you type in (and is hopefully followed by another command prompt).</p>

    <p>The console is therefore how simple Python programs interact with the user who is running them. The <strong>print</strong> statement sends text to the user via the console. Later, we&#39;ll see how a simple Python program can retrieve input from the user via the console.</p>

    <p>Finally, Python itself sends output to the console. For example, that&#39;s where it sends any errors it encounters when it tries to interpret and then run your program. Unfortunately, Python doesn&#39;t really understand what your program is attempting to do, so its feedback is pretty technical, limited to the specific statement where it first noticed the problem, and can sometimes even be <em>misleading</em>!</p>

    <p>In contrast, the &quot;Oops...&quot; messages that sometimes appear after attempting to run Codecademy exercise code have a <em>little</em> better idea about what you&#39;re trying to accomplish, but they&#39;re still automatically generated by code that Mr. Schneider wrote (hidden from you), so they really can&#39;t compare to the interpretation of a human expert.</p>

<div class="exercise-instructions">
    <p>First, just click the <strong>Save &amp; Submit Code</strong> button to see what happens with the statement-free program to the right. Read the console output and try to figure out what each part of it means. Also read the &quot;Oops...&quot; message and think about how Mr. Schneider&#39;s code decides when to display such messages.</p>

    <p>Next, write a Python program that will output the following three lines of text (in sequence):</p>

    <p>Hello, world!<br>
It&#39;s nice to have you here with me.<br>
Take it easy, pal.</p>

    <p>Include a comment line before each of your three print statements that describes something about that statement, such as &quot;This displays the first output line for the user.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise-hint">
    <p>This exercise wants you to write comment and statement pairs like the following:</p>

    <p># The following is a print statement<br>
print &quot;The user will see this.&quot;</p>
