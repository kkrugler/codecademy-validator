# four physical lines using the line continuation character (\)
# (i.e., escaping the carriage return).  Don't change what the
# print statement sends to the console at all.  Make sure that

# that they remain easy to read in the code.

# Print the same sentence and break it in the same places, but
# this time use triple-' syntax.  Note that the apostrophe
# doesn't confuse Python here (though a series of ''' within your
# String literal would).  Note also that the carriage return
# characters are now part of the literal (i.e., the line breaks
# appear in the console output, unlike the ones that were
# escaped above.)
