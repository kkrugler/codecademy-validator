# The following statement uses the % operator to stick the value
# of the last_name variable into the place in the message that is
# marked with the special placeholder %s.

print 'last_name has the value %s.' % last_name

# Note the color that the code window uses to display each of the
# percent symbols above.  The first one (which begins the
# placeholder) is just part of the template String, whereas the
# second one is the formatting operator.

# Use the formatting operator to print the message
# "His name is Kenneth." using the first_name variable, but don't
# forget the period:



# Use the formatting operator to build a new String variable
# full_name that includes both first_name and last_name:



# Finally, use the formatting operator again to print
# "Kenneth Krugler is an awesome programmer!", but use the
# variables full_name and occupation:
